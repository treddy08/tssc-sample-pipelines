      policy: "github.com/enterprise-contract/config//slsa3-strict"

# How to apply (ONE-TIME SETUP - not per app):
# 1. Apply to the SHARED production namespace:
#    oc apply -f release-plan-admission-prod.yaml -n tssc-app-prod
#
# 2. Verify:
#    oc get releaseplanadmission accept-releases -n tssc-app-prod
#
# Important:
# - This is created ONCE for the shared environment
# - NOT per-application (accepts ALL apps from tssc-app-ci)
# - All applications deploy to tssc-app-prod namespace
# - policy: slsa3-STRICT - production has strictest checks
# - No CVEs allowed, all compliance checks must pass
