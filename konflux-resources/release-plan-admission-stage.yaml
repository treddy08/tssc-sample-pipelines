  # Accept releases from CI namespace
  origin: tssc-app-ci

  # NO applications filter - accepts ALL apps (multi-tenant)
  # applications field is OMITTED intentionally

  # Environment identifier
  environment: stage

  # Pipeline runs in tssc-app-ci (cross-namespace reference)

  # Enterprise Contract policy configuration
  data:
    enterpriseContract:
      # Policy for stage (standard - enforces rules)
      policy: "github.com/enterprise-contract/config//slsa3"
      publicKey: "k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets"
      strict: "true"  # Block if policy fails in stage

---
# How to apply (ONE-TIME SETUP - not per app):
# 1. Apply to the SHARED stage namespace:
#    oc apply -f release-plan-admission-stage.yaml -n tssc-app-stage
#
# 2. Verify:
#    oc get releaseplanadmission accept-releases -n tssc-app-stage
#
# Important:
# - This is created ONCE for the shared environment
# - NOT per-application (accepts ALL apps from tssc-app-ci)
# - All applications deploy to tssc-app-stage namespace
# - strict: "true" - stage blocks images with policy violations
